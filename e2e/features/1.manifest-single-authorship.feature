Feature: Manifest Single Authorship
  In order to claim single authorship on a work
  As a creator
  I want to register its manifestation as a piece of content plus some descriptive metadata

  Scenario: Register a piece of content not previously registered
    Given I'm on the home page and authenticated
    When I click submenu option "Register" in menu "Authorship"
    And I uncheck the "upload" option
    And I fill the register form with title "Te Hoho Rock" and content file "Te Hoho Rock.jpg"
    And I wait till finished uploading
    And I click the "Register" button
    Then I see alert with text "Registration submitted"
    And I see modal with text "Te Hoho Rock"

  Scenario: Register a piece of content previously registered
    Given I'm on the home page and authenticated
    When I click submenu option "Register" in menu "Authorship"
    And I uncheck the "upload" option
    And I fill the register form with title "My Te Hoho Rock" and content file "Te Hoho Rock.jpg"
    And I wait till finished uploading
    Then The Register button is disabled
    And I see validation feedback for hash input with text 'Content already registered with title "Te Hoho Rock"'
