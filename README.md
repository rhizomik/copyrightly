### Decentralised Application (ÐApp) for Copyright Management of Social Media

## Description

CopyrightLY is a decentralised application that leverages blockchain and semantic web technologies to facilitate copyright management, for instance:

* Integrated into existing **social media** platforms, it allows content creators to explore ways to **monetise** their media beyond those made possible by those platforms.
* Provides potential **reusers** ways of checking the **authorship** of content they are willing to reuse, and the **conditions** under which it is available.
* Settles a **consensus-based** layer of **authorship** claims to **anchor** copyright transactions like decentralised content markets or Non-Fungible Tokens (**NFTs**).

## Implementation

To do so, creators link content on social media platforms to **on-chain authorship claims** tied to their identities. They can also provide additional **evidence** combining off-chain data and on-chain transactions to sustain those claims. These can be used in case of a copyright **complaint**, even as evidence in court. This approach also discourages false claims, which cannot be retracted once on-chain.

Authorship claims are accompanied by default **reuse terms** modelled using semantic technologies and based on the [Copyright Ontology](https://rhizomik.net/ontologies/copyrightonto), which provides the building blocks to make the terms **machine-actionable**. Reusers can **negotiate** these terms and, after acceptance, on-chain transactions are generated to keep track of the **agreements**.

### Development Status

CopyrightLY's development is documented in the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/rhizomik/copyrightly/wiki).
